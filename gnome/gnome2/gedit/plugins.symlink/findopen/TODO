TODO

* Update this TODO list ;)
* Avoid that 'grep' crash when the input text have special characters.
* Stalls if there are many files matched.
* Harmless broken pipe outputs with too many hits.
* 'find' command on every keystroke (not time-limited)
* Hard max-depth og 10 directories in 'find' command
