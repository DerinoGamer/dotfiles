Neat isn't it?\r\n\r\nSecondly, whenever you execute `make install` your `.dotfiles` directory is scanned for \r\nfiles ending with `.symlink`.\r\n\r\nSome real life examples in order to illustrate how this works:\r\n\r\n* `$DOTFILES`/vim/vimrc.symlink => `$HOME`/.vimrc\r\n* `$DOTFILES`/vim/vim.symlink => `$HOME`/.vim\r\n* `$DOTFILES`/gnome/gnome2/gedit/themes.symlink => `$HOME`/.gnome2/gedit/themes\r\n\r\nThat's all folks. Simple huh? \r\n\r\nA small price to pay for well a organized `.dotfiles` collection which makes updating a joy and breeze.\r\n\r\nScripts\r\n-------\r\nIn the `$DOTFILES/bin` directory (which is automatically added to the PATH) there are\r\na couple of `helper` or `wrapper` scripts which make my life easier in the first place\r\nand they might do the same for yours.\r\n\r\nI would like to highlight the `dot-aliases` script which will list all your registered aliases\r\nsorted by topic inside your `.dotfiles` directory. You can even filter by topic using `dot-aliases mytopic`.\r\n\r\nAlso the `dot-update` will update your `.dotfiles` regardless of your current directory and it will also\r\nautomatically reload your `.bashrc`.\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright (c) 2011-2012, Mihail Szabolcs\r\n\r\nEverything is provided **as-is** under the **MIT** license.
